# Calculator-Java
My First GitHub Project (Simple Calculator on Java with detailed comments) 

> **Disclaimer**: I'm still learning how to properly structure and format my GitHub projects. This is my very first repository, and I’m excited (but also a bit nervous) to share it with the world!

## Introduction

> **Yesterday I finally started maintaining my GitHub page. This is my first project. In fact, it was made two years ago, but I need something for my portfolio, so here it is.**

> **I tried to describe everything as thoroughly and clearly as possible, so that even your grandmother could understand.**

> **The calculator design was inspired by the calculator on my OnePlus.**

This **Calculator** is a simple Java application with a Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI). It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and includes a heavily commented codebase to help beginners understand how each part works.

## Project Overview

- **Dark Themed Interface**: Uses a gradient background and colored buttons (inspired by OnePlus calculator).
- **Core Arithmetic**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulo (`%`).
- **Keyboard Input**: You can use your keyboard to type numbers, operators, and press `Enter` for the equals operation.
- **Error Handling**: Displays `"Error"` if the expression cannot be evaluated.
- **Delete & Clear**: Remove the last character with `⌫` or clear everything with `C`.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher (tested primarily on Java 21).
